# Breast-Cancer-Detection-using-SVM
This project demonstrates how to use a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict breast cancer using the popular Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset from scikit-learn.


Key points:

Uses a linear kernel SVM to classify tumors as malignant or benign.

Achieves high accuracy (around 95%) on the test set.

Includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation.

You can easily run and modify this code to experiment with different kernels, hyperparameters, or even other classification algorithms.
